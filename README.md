# Week-9-Project-Pentesting-Live-Targets


Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: Session Hijacking/Fixation

Description: I opened both browers to blue. On the screen on the right the user was logged in, but the user on the left was not. I changed the IDs using "/public/hacktools/change_session_id.php" in both browers to the same ID so I could log in in both browers, without knowing the login credentials.

Vulnerability #2: SQL Injection (SQLi)

Description:

I used SQL injection: ' OR SLEEP(3)=0--'

## Green

Vulnerability #1: User Enumeration

Description: The web broswer gave hints to if a user account exist. In this case if the user existed the "Log in was unsuccessful." would be bold, but if the user didn't exist it would be plain.

Vulnerability #2: Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

Description: When leaving feedback I added JavaScript code "<script>alert('found this');</script>". So when the user opens the message an alert box will pop up.

## Red

Vulnerability #1: Indirect Object referencing (IDOR)

Description: When using IDOR vulnerability in the red application you can see any account. You can see deactivated accouts, so by going through the salespersons account with "/public/salesperson.php?id=~", using differnet id numbers, I was able to find an account that was deactivated.

Vulnerability #2: Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Description: With two red browers open you can trick the admin into opening a hidden form. In the inspect tool I changed the form to value="not_real_token", then I was able to make changes to the form.

## Notes

A challenge I faced working on this project was making sure my browsers were in sync when making changes.
